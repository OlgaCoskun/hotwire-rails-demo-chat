# Hotwire Rails Demo: Chat

This is a slimmed-down repository for the Hotwire demo that used for [the announcement screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKY-QES1XQQ).

It's a rough sketch of the very basics. Maybe we could improve it together?

To setup, just run `./bin/setup`, then `./bin/rails server`, then hit `localhost:3000`.
